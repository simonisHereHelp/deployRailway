Welcome to Training Video 7.2

00:03.500 --> 00:11.000
To start, strip approximately 4mm of the cable outer jacket using a blade breaker. Make sure to handle the tools with care.

00:11.500 --> 00:35.000
Next, separate the outer conductors by pulling the insulator off the main line of the coaxial cable. Carefully remove the insulator to avoid damaging the conductors. This step is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the cable.

00:35.500 --> 00:54.000
Hold the outer conductors with tweezers and twist them by rotating the outer jacket with the opposite hand. Your steady hands and attention to detail will ensure a tight, neat twist that will aid in the soldering process.

00:54.500 --> 01:11.000
Apply a thin layer of solder paste and tin the outer and center conductors. Temperature 350C.

01:31.500 --> 01:54.000
Cut approximately half the outer conductors closest to the stripped edge of the outer jacket with wire cutters. This precise cut ensures that the remaining conductors can be easily managed and soldered without excess material.

Strip the outer conductor a blade breaker.

Cut the lower section of the array with a blade breaker and double edge blade. 

03:31.500 --> 03:42.000
Place the subassembly array on an aluminum base plate with double-sided tape. Secure it well to prevent any movement during the next steps.


03:42.500 --> 03:46.000
Do Not the whole unit onto the tape, cause problems when need to take it off later.

Next is to prep the conductors. First, trim the outer conductor.

04:13.500 --> 04:16.000
next trim the dielectric insulator.

04:31.500 --> 04:44.000
Great. Solder the outer conductor to the ground pad of the transducer subassembly. Make sure the solder joint is clean and strong. A well-soldered joint ensures durability and reliability.

05:00.500 --> 05:13.000
next, solder the dielectric insulator. Take care not to join wires with the outer conductor when soldering.

05:32.500 --> 05:41.000

## the Solution

To counter the existing problems and to prepare for future advancements, this proposal introduces an innovative solution that includes:

-  **Pass-Thru Videos,**

-  **WI-Video links,**

-  **Kiosk** (hardware stand), and a;

-  **Bot App** featuring supportive snippets



### 1. Why Pass-thru Video?

>Provides **contextual reference** by combining the target object and training video **in a single view**, enhancing training outcomes.

Pass-thru videos use a **chroma-keyed background**, creating a **transparent effect** when played on modern browsers with **webcam access**. 


This technique platform is perfect for current **line operator training**, as it seamlessly integrates coach videos into a hands-on learning context right **in front of** the acutal work object.

- **Contextual Learning**: ideal for line operators.
- **Cost-Effectiveüí∞**: Cheap to produce.
- **Reliable TechüíØ**: Well-established technology.
- **Broad CompatibilityüëÄ**: Works across most devices and environments.

- **AI Friendly Video format**: Features LBN (**Low Background Noise**). This characteristic leads to higher success rates in machine learning training sessions. (Same length of video, but less GPU time!)

### 2. Why (and How to) Use WI-Video Links?
 
- **Link Connection**: Alignment of WI (work instruction) tags with video timeline.

- **Cross Reference**: Presenting a comprehensive view of work instruction.

- **Format**: Utilizes closed caption (CC) files, compatible with any video player.

- **Dynamic Nature**: Updates links automatically as work instructions change (?).

- **Version Control (?)**: subject to investigate (?)

### 3. Why Kiosk (stand)?
- **Workflow View:** Offers a close-up view of the operator's workflow.

- **Enhanced Visibility:** Delivers a clear, top-down perspective for accurate task execution.

- **Cleanroom Compatibility:** Keeps the bench workspace uncluttered, easy to clean, and compliant with cleanroom standards.

- **Communication Channel:** Features Zoom integration for sharing views with external parties outside the cleanroom.


### 4. Why Use a Bot?

- **Enhanced UX**: Offers a modern and user-friendly interface.

- **No Key Input**: Ideal for line operators, eliminating the need for keyboard interaction.

- **Easy Maintenance**: Modifications can be made remotely via cloud services.

- **Connect and Engage**: Communicates Provisio's values and appreciation effectively, fostering a connection with line operators and recognizing their contributions.

### 4.5 Bot's Functional Blocks

- **Greeting & Engagement**: the openning session

- **Video Catalog**: by group.

- **Work Instructions**: by group.

- **Join ZOOM**: join an existing Zoom meeting.

- **Scan-b4-Filing**: check manual filled forms to enforce **GDP (good documentation practice)**.
